### Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)

**Definition**:  
Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) is a systems biology method for analyzing gene expression data. It identifies clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes and relates these modules to external traits, helping uncover biological insights, identify biomarkers, and understand functional pathways.
